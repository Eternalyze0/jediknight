# Return of the Jedi (Playing Jedi Knight Jedi Academy with Deep Curious A3C Learning)

Six neural networks combine to form ðŸ¦‹AI.

ðŸ¦‹AI explores half of Tattooine in half an hour, defeats Jedi Trainer 1-0 despite starting at a disadvantage, defeats Cultist 3-1, and defeats the final boss of the game Desann 20-11. 

ðŸ¦‹AI employs curiosity to efficiently learn to do all this in mere hours of training on one modest 8GB GPU.
